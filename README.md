# Speed-runners App

## üèÉ About The App

Speed-runners is a mobile application designed to help runners improve their performance. By providing real-time feedback on **speed, pace, and acceleration**, the app acts as a personal running coach. It uses your device's GPS to track your run and a text-to-speech feature to give you audio cues and encouragement to help you stay on track with your target pace.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Tracking**: Monitors your distance, speed, and acceleration as you run.

* **Target Pace Setting**: Allows you to set a desired pace (e.g., 5:30 per km) to guide your workout.

* **Audio Feedback**: Gives you verbal updates every minute, telling you if you are ahead of, behind, or on pace.

* **Screen Awake**: Keeps your screen on during the run so you can easily check your stats.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The app uses the Haversine formula to accurately calculate the distance between GPS coordinates. It then uses this data, along with timestamps, to determine your current speed and acceleration. All of this information is used to provide timely and relevant feedback.
